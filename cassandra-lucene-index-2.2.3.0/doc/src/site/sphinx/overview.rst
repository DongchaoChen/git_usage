Overview
********

`Cassandra <http://cassandra.apache.org/>`__ index functionality has
been extended to provide near real time search such as
`ElasticSearch <http://www.elasticsearch.org/>`__ or
`Solr <https://lucene.apache.org/solr/>`__, including full text search
capabilities and multivariable, geospatial and bitemporal search.

It is also fully compatible with `Apache
Spark <https://spark.apache.org/>`__ and `Apache
Hadoop <https://hadoop.apache.org/>`__, allowing you to filter data at
database level. This speeds up jobs reducing the amount of data to be
collected and processed.

This project is not intended to replace Apache Cassandra denormalized
tables, inverted indexes, and/or secondary indexes. It is just a tool
to perform some kind of queries which are really hard to be addressed
using Apache Cassandra out of the box features.

Indexing is achieved through a Lucene based implementation of Cassandra
secondary indexes, where each node of the cluster indexes its own data.
Stratio Cassandra is one of the core modules on which Stratio's BigData
platform (SDS) is based.

Architecture
============

Indexing is achieved through a Lucene based implementation of Apache Cassandra secondary indexes.
Cassandra's secondary indexes are local indexes,
meaning that each node of the cluster indexes it's own data.
As usual in Cassandra, each node can act as search coordinator.
The coordinator node sends the searches to all the involved nodes,
and then it post-processes the returned rows to return the required ones.
This post-processing is particularly important in top-k queries.

Regarding to the Cassandra-Lucene mapping, each node has a single Lucene index per indexed table,
and each logic CQL row is mapped to a Lucene document.
This documents are composed by the user-defined fields, the primary key and the partitioner's token.
Indexing is done in a synchronous fashion at the storage layer, so each row upsert implies a document upsert.
This adds an extra cost for write operations, which is the price of the provided search features.
As long as indexing is done below the distribution layer,
replication has been already achieved when the rows come to the index.

Requirements
============


-  Cassandra (identified by the three first numbers of the plugin version)
-  Java >= 1.7 (OpenJDK and Sun have been tested)
-  Maven >= 3.0

Installation
============

Stratio’s Cassandra Lucene Index is distributed as a plugin for Apache Cassandra. Thus, you just need to build a JAR
containing the plugin and add it to the Cassandra’s classpath:

-  Build the plugin with Maven: ``mvn clean package``
-  Copy the generated JAR to the lib folder of your compatible Cassandra installation:
   ``cp plugin/target/cassandra-lucene-index-plugin-*.jar <CASSANDRA_HOME>/lib/``
-  Start/restart Cassandra as usual.    

Alternatively, patching can also be done with this Maven profile, specifying the path of your Cassandra installation,
this task also delete previous plugin's JAR versions in CASSANDRA_HOME/lib/ directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    mvn clean package -Ppatch -Dcassandra_home=<CASSANDRA_HOME>

If you don’t have an installed version of Cassandra, there is also an alternative profile to let Maven download and
patch the proper version of Apache Cassandra:

.. code-block:: bash

    mvn clean package -Pdownload_and_patch -Dcassandra_home=<CASSANDRA_HOME>

Now you can run Cassandra and do some tests using the Cassandra Query Language:

.. code-block:: bash

    <CASSANDRA_HOME>/bin/cassandra -f
    <CASSANDRA_HOME>/bin/cqlsh

The Lucene’s index files will be stored in the same directories where the Cassandra’s will be. The default data
directory is ``/var/lib/cassandra/data``, and each index is placed next to the SSTables of its indexed column family.

For more details about Apache Cassandra please see its `documentation <http://cassandra.apache.org/>`__.

Example
=======

We will create the following table to store tweets:

.. code-block:: sql

    CREATE KEYSPACE demo
    WITH REPLICATION = {'class' : 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1};
    USE demo;
    CREATE TABLE tweets (
        id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        user TEXT,
        body TEXT,
        time TIMESTAMP,
        latitude FLOAT,
        longitude FLOAT,
        lucene TEXT
    );

We have created a column called *lucene* to link the index searches. This column will not store data. Now you can create
a custom Lucene index on it with the following statement:

.. code-block:: sql

    CREATE CUSTOM INDEX tweets_index ON tweets (lucene)
    USING 'com.stratio.cassandra.lucene.Index'
    WITH OPTIONS = {
        'refresh_seconds' : '1',
        'schema' : '{
            fields : {
                id    : {type : "integer"},
                user  : {type : "string"},
                body  : {type : "text", analyzer : "english"},
                time  : {type : "date", pattern : "yyyy/MM/dd", sorted : true},
                place : {type : "geo_point", latitude:"latitude", longitude:"longitude"}
            }
        }'
    };

This will index all the columns in the table with the specified types, and it will be refreshed once per second.
Alternatively, you can explicitly refresh all the index shards with an empty search with consistency ``ALL``:

.. code-block:: sql

    CONSISTENCY ALL
    SELECT * FROM tweets WHERE lucene = '{refresh:true}';
    CONSISTENCY QUORUM

Now, to search for tweets within a certain date range:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT * FROM tweets WHERE lucene='{
        filter : {type:"range", field:"time", lower:"2014/04/25", upper:"2014/05/01"}
    }' limit 100;

The same search can be performed forcing an explicit refresh of the involved index shards:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT * FROM tweets WHERE lucene='{
        filter : {type:"range", field:"time", lower:"2014/04/25", upper:"2014/05/01"},
        refresh : true
    }' limit 100;

Now, to search the top 100 more relevant tweets where *body* field contains the phrase “big data gives organizations”
within the aforementioned date range:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT * FROM tweets WHERE lucene='{
        filter : {type:"range", field:"time", lower:"2014/04/25", upper:"2014/05/01"},
        query  : {type:"phrase", field:"body", value:"big data gives organizations", slop:1}
    }' limit 100;

To refine the search to get only the tweets written by users whose name starts with "a":

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT * FROM tweets WHERE lucene='{
        filter : {type:"boolean", must:[
                       {type:"range", field:"time", lower:"2014/04/25", upper:"2014/05/01"},
                       {type:"prefix", field:"user", value:"a"} ] },
        query  : {type:"phrase", field:"body", value:"big data gives organizations", slop:1}
    }' limit 100;

To get the 100 more recent filtered results you can use the *sort* option:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT * FROM tweets WHERE lucene='{
        filter : {type:"boolean", must:[
                       {type:"range", field:"time", lower:"2014/04/25", upper:"2014/05/01"},
                       {type:"prefix", field:"user", value:"a"} ] },
        query  : {type:"phrase", field:"body", value:"big data gives organizations", slop:1},
        sort   : {fields: [ {field:"time", reverse:true} ] }
    }' limit 100;

The previous search can be restricted to a geographical bounding box:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT * FROM tweets WHERE lucene='{
        filter : {type:"boolean", must:[
                       {type:"range", field:"time", lower:"2014/04/25", upper:"2014/05/01"},
                       {type:"prefix", field:"user", value:"a"},
                       {type:"geo_bbox",
                        field:"place",
                        min_latitude:40.225479,
                        max_latitude:40.560174,
                        min_longitude:-3.999278,
                        max_longitude:-3.378550} ] },
        query  : {type:"phrase", field:"body", value:"big data gives organizations", slop:1},
        sort   : {fields: [ {field:"time", reverse:true} ] }
    }' limit 100;

Alternatively, you can restrict the search to retrieve tweets that are within a specific distance from a geographical
position:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT * FROM tweets WHERE lucene='{
        filter : {type:"boolean", must:[
                       {type:"range", field:"time", lower:"2014/04/25", upper:"2014/05/01"},
                       {type:"prefix", field:"user", value:"a"},
                       {type:"geo_distance",
                        field:"place",
                        latitude:40.393035,
                        longitude:-3.732859,
                        max_distance:"10km",
                        min_distance:"100m"} ] },
        query  : {type:"phrase", field:"body", value:"big data gives organizations", slop:1},
        sort   : {fields: [ {field:"time", reverse:true} ] }
    }' limit 100;
